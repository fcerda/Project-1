    <center><h2>About me</h2></center>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi! My name is Fernando Cerda. I’m originally from Chile, South America. I moved out here a few years ago for my work and have loved every minute of my time since I’ve been here. You’ll probably see me hiking, working out, or spending way too much time with my family in the park. I love programming as well as running, hiking, playing music.  I am a software developer and a geoscientist. I worked in the oil industry for quite sometime and now, I'm looking to help those that need web development work done or searching for ideas and management for their next content project.</p>

    <center><h2>My profile</h2></center>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you already looked at my resume, you will see that I am an experienced professional with strong understanding of performance evaluation. I am an excellent problem solving.  Personally, I have excellent verbal and written skills along with analytical and organizational skills and the ability to provide excellent customer service.  I am highly motivated, dedicated, and detailed oriented with the ability to work efficiently with other professionals in the field or independently.    I have worked internationally for almost all my entire career and as such, I easily adapt to new situations with a positive and professional attitude toward working within the organization’s standards.  </p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#EFE7BC;">
    <center><h2>My projects</h2></center>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I have over 10 years in the oil and gas industry, particularly in seismic acquisition, data processing and reservoir analysis.  During my extensive career, I have been able to manage simultaneous operation with teams on three different continents (Seismic acquisition and data processing and data analysis).  I have also worked as full stack web developer. If you go to my project page, I will show you some of the projects I have worked on.  Thanks very much for your time.</p>
